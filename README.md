## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher recommended)
- **Expo CLI** (run `npm install -g expo-cli` to install)
- **Git** (for version control)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nine-chairs/os-meus-eventos.git
   cd os-meus-eventos
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Expo Go on your mobile device:**

   - You can download **Expo Go** from the [App Store (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) or [Google Play Store (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent).

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store environment-specific variables, such as API URLs or keys.

Example of `.env` content:

```plaintext
API_URL=https://api.yourservice.com
AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

Add any environment variables that the app relies on here, and ensure they are accessed securely within the codebase.

## Running the App

1. **Start the Expo server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will launch the Expo developer tools in your browser. You can use this tool to scan the QR code with the **Expo Go** app on your mobile device.

2. **Running on a Physical Device:**

   - Open the **Expo Go** app on your device and scan the QR code shown in the terminal or Expo developer tools.

3. **Running on an Emulator:**

   - For Android, ensure you have an emulator running (or a connected Android device) and click "Run on Android device/emulator" in the Expo developer tools.
   - For iOS, ensure you have Xcode installed and click "Run on iOS simulator" (only available on macOS).

## Available Scripts

- **`npm start`**: Starts the Expo development server.
- **`npm run ios`**: Runs the app on an iOS simulator (macOS only).
- **`npm run android`**: Runs the app on an Android emulator.
- **`npm run web`**: Runs the app in a web browser (experimental).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the app, make sure you have the latest version of the Expo CLI and check for any error messages in the terminal. Restarting the Expo server often resolves minor issues.
